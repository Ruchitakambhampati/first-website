       <p>Computer science is a vast field that explores the theory and application of algorithms, data structures, and computation. Machine learning, a subfield of computer science, focuses on developing algorithms that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It empowers systems to recognize patterns, adapt to new information, and improve their performance over time, revolutionizing various industries from healthcare to finance.</p>
